/**
 * Application entry point -- this class represents the starting
 * point for our game.  Main is executed by the 'main' thread of
 * execution.  Behind the scenes, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have
 * their own thread of execution.  This code builds a GameControl
 * object, then asks the GUI thread to 'run' it.
 * 
 * Once the GameControl object is running in the GUI thread, we let
 * the main thread of execution end.  (Execution reaches the end of 
 * main the main thread terminates.)  Note that the application will
 * keep running (in the GUI thread) as long as the GUI thread exists 
 * and there are GUI objects (the JFrame) on the screen.
 * 
 * (This idea, that there can be multiple threads of execution in
 * a single program is common to many programming laguages.  Almost
 * all of them have the restriction that GUI drawing needs to 
 * happen from a special GUI thread.)
